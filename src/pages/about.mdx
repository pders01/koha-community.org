<YouTube id="uHav6PL_4Bo" />

Koha is the first free software library automation package. In use worldwide, its development is steered by a growing community of users collaborating to achieve their technology goals. Koha’s feature set continues to evolve and expand to meet the needs of its user base.

**Full-featured ILS.** In use [worldwide in libraries of all sizes](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Koha_Users_Worldwide), Koha is a true enterprise-class ILS with comprehensive functionality including basic and advanced options. Koha includes modules for acquisitions, circulation, cataloging, serials management, authorities, flexible reporting, label printing, multi-format notices, offline circulation for when Internet access is not available, and much more. Koha will work for consortia of all sizes, multi-branch, and single-branch libraries.

**Multilingual and translatable.** Koha has a large number of [available languages](http://translate.koha-community.org), with more languages every year.

**Full text searching** Powerful searching, and an enhanced catalogue display that can use content from Amazon, Google, LibraryThing, Open Library, and Syndetics, among others.

**Library Standards Compliant.** Koha is built using library standards and protocols such as MARC 21, UNIMARC, z39.50, SRU/SW, SIP2, SIP/NCIP, ensuring interoperability between Koha and other systems and technologies, while supporting existing workflows and tools.

**Web-based Interfaces.** Koha’s OPAC, circ, management and self-checkout interfaces are all based on standards-compliant World Wide Web technologies–XHTML, CSS and Javascript–making Koha a truly platform-independent solution.

**Free Software / Open Source.** Koha is distributed under the Free Software [General Public License (GPL) version 3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

**No Vendor Lock-in.** It is an important part of the free software promise that there is no vendor lock-in: libraries are free to install and use Koha themselves if the have the in-house expertise or to purchase support or development services from the best available sources. Libraries should be free to change support company and export their data at any time, make sure your support company allows this, it’s also important to make sure it uses a good data management system ([click for more info](https://www.couchbase.com/transactions)).
