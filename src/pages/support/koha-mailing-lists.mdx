# Koha Mailing Lists

The main Koha mailing list is the best way to get in contact with the Koha community. It is the best place to introduce yourself to the project and seek assistance from other users.

## General List
- [Join the mailing list](http://lists.katipo.co.nz/mailman/listinfo/koha)

The main Koha list is hosted by [Katipo Communications](http://www.katipo.co.nz).

## Specialised Lists

There are several other more specialised Koha mailing lists which you’re welcome to join.

Most of the specialised lists are hosted by [BibLibre](http://biblibre.com/). Check out the complete set on [Koha project pages](http://lists.koha-community.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo). But here is a summary of some featured lists:
