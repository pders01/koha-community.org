# Web Forums

If you prefer to discuss Koha in a web forum, we have the following forum versions of our discussions:

- [Markmail](http://koha.markmail.org/search/?q=)
- [Nabble](http://koha.1045719.n5.nabble.com/)
- [Mail Archive](http://www.mail-archive.com/find.php?q=koha)

These websites are all connected to the same forums: posting a message to one will appear on all of them, after a short delay. You can also receive these forums [by email](/support/koha-mailing-lists/) if you wish.
