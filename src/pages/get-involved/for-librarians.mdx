# For Librarians

## So you’re a librarian, and your library uses Koha. That’s great! Welcome to the community!

Yes, really. That’s all it takes! Koha is the project it is because librarians like you contribute your time and effort to helping make Koha better.

You don’t have to write code to contribute. Here are a few ways you can help out:

- [Reporting Bugs](http://bugs.koha-community.org) ([How to write good bug reports for Koha](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Bug_Reporting_Guidelines))
- [Submitting your ideas (RFC’s)](http://koha-community.org/about/enhancing-koha/)
- [Contributing your custom reports](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library)
- [Translating Koha into your language](http://translate.koha-community.org)
- [Understanding Koha’s bug reporting workflow (or, what happens to that bug I just submitted?)](http://www.myacpl.org/koha/?p=555)
- Helping with documentation
- Testing!
