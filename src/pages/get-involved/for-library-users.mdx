# For Library Users

## We always love to hear from users of Koha… not just librarians, but normal people like you who have to interact with the catalog in order to use the library.

### We are always looking for ways to improve Koha’s catalog:

- What would make it **even easier** for you to use your library’s catalog?
- Is there **anything that annoys you** about your library’s catalog?
- “Boy, **it sure would be cool** if the library catalog…”

Share your great idea with us on our Bug tracker at [https://bugs.koha-community.org/](https://bugs.koha-community.org/)
