# Get Involved

Get involved in the Koha community! There are many ways to contribute and help make the project better. Here are some ideas:

- [For Librarians](http://koha-community.org/get-involved/for-librarians/) (but see also [the demonstration sites](http://koha-community.org/demo/))
- [For Developers](http://koha-community.org/for-developers/)
- [My library uses Koha](http://koha-community.org/get-involved/for-library-users/) – Does your library use Koha? Do you have a peeve or a kudo about it? Let us know!
- [The Release Team](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Release_Teams)
- [Translation](http://translate.koha-community.org/) – Can you speak other languages? Would you be interested in translating? We’d love your help.
- [Community](http://koha-community.org/support/community-support/) – Koha has a great community to get involved in.
- [Chat](http://koha-community.org/get-involved/irc) – Have queries? Want to talk? Come and chat with us.
- [Documentation](http://koha-community.org/documentation) – Good documentation allows users so solve their own problems if they run into trouble. We always need more people to help us write good documentations.
