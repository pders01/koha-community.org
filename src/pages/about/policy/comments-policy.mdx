# Comments Policy

Comments on this site are moderated (damn spammers) but most comments will be approved once a moderator reviews them. Abusive (technically or expressively), off-topic, illegal, hate-inciting or sweary comments may and probably will be deleted.

Comments are closed after 30 days on all news items. Information pages do not allow comments: please post general questions to [our mailing lists](/support/koha-mailing-lists/) or [web forums](/support/forums/).

Moderators may expire old comments after a reasonable time.

If you disagree with a moderatorâ€™s decision, please appeal during one of the chat ([IRC](http://koha-community.org/get-involved/irc/)) meetings. They are announced on the forums from time to time or you can ask in the chat session for the time of the next meeting.
