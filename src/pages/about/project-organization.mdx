# Project Organization

Technical decisions concerning the development of Koha are made every day by a variety of people:

- Individual developers
- Libraries who directly or indirectly contribute or sponsor new features
- Members of the release team

Discussion of development matters takes place on the #koha IRC channel and the Koha mailing lists.

The Horowhenua Library Trust, with the advice and consent of the Koha community, has established a committee empowered to:

- to advise the Trustees regarding the acquisition and safeguarding of property of the Koha project;
- to advise the Trustees regarding the disposal of property of the Koha project;
- to represent to the Trustees the views of the Koha community, insofar as these can be determined through the various forums that may exist from time to time within the community;
- to make any other representations to the Trustees that the Committee believes to be in the best interests of the Koha project

The [rules of this committee](http://koha-community.org/koha-project-organization/horowhenua-library-trust-koha-committee-rules/) are posted on this website.

The current members of this committee are

- Bob Birchall (Member at Large per clause 5.6)

- Frédéric Démians (Translation Manager)
- Chris Cormack
- Rachel Hamilton-Williams (Kaitiaki)
- Chris Nighswonger (3.2, 3.4, 3.6 Release Maintainer)
