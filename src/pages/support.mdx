# Support

The many support options for Koha demonstrate the strength of the open-source development model. Because Koha is a distributed open-source product, support options are not limited to what is provided by a single vendor. In fact, an important part of the open-source promise is that there is no vendor lock-in. Libraries are free to support the product in-house or obtain help from a support company.
